# GOES-R-animation
script to animate geostationary weather data

The script requires the following python packages
-numpy
-matplotlib
-netCDF4
-astropy (or some other way to parse Julian Calendar times)
-ffmpeg

I have included one example netCDF4 file, but you can download more from https://www.class.noaa.gov/
